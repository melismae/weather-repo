# cascade weather

Repo for Cascade Energy challenge. Link is TBD, but for now, here's how to run.

First, install the dependencies:

`$ npm install`

For JavaScript development, use the webpack dev server... it has hot reloading of JS & CSS

`$ npm run dev`

To build the app, use

`$ npm run build`

You'll also need to build the CSS:

`$ npm run build:css`

The static files end up in the build directory.
