# cascade weather

Repo for Cascade Energy challenge. Written in React & Redux.

Here's how to run:

First, install the dependencies:

`$ npm install`

For JavaScript development, use the webpack dev server... it has hot reloading of JS & CSS and you'll also see the Redux devtools if you have the Chrome extension.

`$ npm run dev`

Since this isn't deployed to production, the API key is hard coded in the action where the call is made.
